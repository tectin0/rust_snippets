# Rust Snippets

Welcome to the Rust Snippets repository! This collection of small code snippets aims to explore various concepts and features of the **Rust** programming language. Each snippet is self-contained and focuses on a specific topic, allowing you to easily grasp different aspects of **Rust**.

## Key Features

- **Readable Code**: All snippets utilize the `#[test]` attribute, along with assertions, to ensure code clarity and understanding. You can explore and comprehend the code (mostly) solely through the source itself, without the need for compiling or running.

- **Comparisons**: To highlight the unique features of Rust, some snippets include comparisons with equivalent code in other languages such as **C** or **Python**. These comparisons serve as a useful reference point, allowing you to discern the advantages and differences offered by **Rust**.

- **Modifiable Code**: These snippets provide an environment where you can modify the source code and observe how it impacts the test assertions.

- **Interactive Testing with Visual Studio Code**: If you're using Visual Studio Code, you can easily execute the `#[test]` attributes individually. This allows for a more interactive experience when running the tests and exploring the code.

## Enjoy Exploring!

Feel free to browse through the code snippets in the repository's `rust` directory. Each snippet is contained within its own function and multiple snippets are grouped together based on topic in a file.

The **C** source is located in the `c` directory and an additional `rustinc` directory exists to give one example on how to use **Rust** in **C**.

Open the files using your preferred text editor or IDE, such as Visual Studio Code, to examine the code in detail. You can review and study the snippets independently or modify the code to observe the effects on the test assertions.
